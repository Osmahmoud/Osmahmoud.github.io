## Expertise

<p align="justify">
My expertise lies within Data Science, Medical Statistics and Bio-Statistics domains with extensive practice of:
</p>

  - Causal inference.
  - Machine learning.
  - Longitudinal data analyses.
  - Epidemiology.

<p align="justify">
My <a href="/Research/Selected-projects" title="List of projects" target="_blank">research projects</a> have led to a track record of <a href="/Research" title="List of publications" target="_blank">publications</a> in prestigious world-leading academic journals.
</p>

<p align="justify">
I have a great passion for <a href="/Teaching" title="My teaching activities" target="_blank">teaching</a> Statistics and Data Science, and have taught them since 2004 in a variety of learning environments across three higher educational institutions in the UK and Egypt.
</p>

<p align="justify">
I am running a number of <a href="/R-courses" title="Details on R courses" target="_blank">Statistical and Data Science courses</a> at several locations across Europe. I do deliver courses on-sites as well. If you are representing an institution and interested in finding out more details, please feel free to contact me.
</p>

<p align="justify">
I have an extensive experience on writing software commands, mainly using R, for newly developed statistical techniques as well as for effectively applying existing methods. I am an author of a number of statistical and machine learning methods whose <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/collaborators/name/Osama%20Mahmoud" target="_blank" title="Published packages"> software packages</a> are published on the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/" target="_blank" title="Comprehensive R Archive Network">CRAN</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Osmahmoud" target="_blank" title="My Github">Github</a>, and purpose websites such as
the <a href="http://osmahmoud.com/SlopeHunter/index.html" target="_blank" title="Slope-Hunter method">Slope-Hunter method</a>. Moreover, I am the main developer, author/co-author for a number of <a href="/Shiny" title="List of web applications" target="_blank">web applications</a> in bio-medical sciences.
