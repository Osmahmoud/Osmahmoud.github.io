I am a <a href="https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/abdel02200/osama-mahmoud" target="_blank"><strong>Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Data Science & Statistics</strong></a> at the <a href="https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/mathematical-sciences" target="_blank">Department of Mathematical Sciences</a>, University of Essex, United Kingdom.

My expertise lies within <strong>Biostatistics</strong> and <strong>Medical Statistics</strong> domains with extensive practice of high dimensional data sets, particularly from functional genomic experiments. Developing and effectively applying advanced machine learning techniques, <em>e.g. clustering and classification approaches</em>, are a key strength of my research profile. Applications of multilevel modelling with high throughput data sets, causal inference in gentic epidemiological studeis are the core of my present research focus.

I have completed my Ph.D. in <strong>Biostatistics</strong> at the University of Essex, UK. My thesis was entitled '<a href="http://serlib0.essex.ac.uk/search%7ES5?/aMahmoud%2C+Osama/amahmoud+osama/-3%2C-1%2C0%2CB/frameset&FF=amahmoud+osama&1%2C1%2C" target="_blank">Improving Statistical Learning within Functional Genomic Experiments by means of Feature Selection</a>' and supervised by <a href="https://www.essex.ac.uk/maths/staff/profile.aspx?ID=1277" target="_blank">Prof. Berthold Lausen</a> and <a href="https://www.essex.ac.uk/maths/staff/profile.aspx?ID=1270" target="_blank">Dr. Andrew Harrison</a>. My Ph.D. thesis proposed a novel technique, named <a href="http://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-15-274" target="_blank"><strong>Proportion Overlapping Score (POS)</strong></a>, for identifying most informative genes in considered classification problems. The POS approach was further extended to minimize redundancy among genes selected based on the developed overlapping analysis. This extension led to the presentation of the <a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-25226-1_24" target="_blank"><strong>POSr method</strong></a>. I have obtained my MSc. and Bachelor in Applied Statistics from <a href="http://www.helwan.edu.eg/English/" target="_blank">Helwan University</a>, Egypt.

I have an extensive experience on writing <strong>software commands</strong> for newly developed statistical techniques as well as for applying existing methods, mainly using the R statistical programming environment. In addition, I enjoy developing useful software tools to help other researchers in dealing with data &mdash; <a href="/Research/Selected-projects" target="_blank">check out my projects</a>. I am an expert in using numerous tools for reproducible research including Rmarkdown, Sweave, advanced R graphics, Knitr and Shiny. I am an author for a number of published R packages such as: <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/propOverlap/index.html" target="_blank"><strong>PropOverlap</strong></a>; <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ESKNN/index.html" target="_blank"><strong>ESKNN</strong></a>; <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/OTE/index.html" target="_blank"><strong>OTE</strong></a>.
