Type 2 diabetes is relatively rare in the UK. This study aims mainly to establish the UK incidence of Type 2 Diabetes in children aged under 17 years. A prospective monthly surveillance of new cases of Type 2 Diabetes in children aged 0 â€“ 16 years was conducted from April 2015 to April 2016. The findings would be compared with the last survey conducted by the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit in 2005.
