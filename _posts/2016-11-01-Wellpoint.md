Health screening in work has become a key issue in improving employee performance and reducing the risk of healthcare costs. Electronic kiosks, as automated tools for occupational health check, can be set up in a workplace to monitor employee well-being by providing health related information. Wellpoint have developed a range of health kiosks and the UK Department of Health, local UK councils as well as NHS have deployed many of them at their borough for members of staff and public to use.

The kiosks record physical measures, e.g. body mass index (BMI), body fat content, blood pressure and heart rate, and can include specific questions, for instance, relating to medical history. These inputs along-with some demographic information; e.g. age, sex, ethnicity and post-code, can be used to estimate a user's risk of having a cardiovascular event (i.e., heart attack or stroke) over the next ten years (known as the QRISK score).
