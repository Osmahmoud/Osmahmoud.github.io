<p align="justify">
Cholesterol screening for children with Type 1 diabetes is controversial. The <a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/" target="_blank">NICE</a> guidelines on childhood type 1 diabetes do not recommend cholesterol screening.  However, the <a href="http://www.rcpch.ac.uk/national-paediatric-diabetes-audit-npda" target="_blank">National Audit (NPDA)</a> has an annual cholesterol measure for children over 12 years old as a key outcome indicator.
